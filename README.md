## Goal
The objective of this project is to implement U-Net, a convolutional neural network (CNN) tailored for rapid and accurate image segmentation. The focus is on predicting a label for every individual pixel in an image, specifically those sourced from a self-driving car dataset.

## Overview
Semantic image segmentation, the core task addressed here, involves assigning a precise label to each pixel in an image. While akin to object detection in the sense that both aim to identify objects and their locations in an image, semantic image segmentation goes a step further. Unlike object detection, which leverages bounding boxes that may encompass non-object pixels, semantic image segmentation provides a detailed mask for each object by classifying every pixel with its corresponding class.

## Importance
In the context of self-driving cars, accurate region-specific labeling is paramount. A pixel-level comprehension of the environment enables the vehicle to navigate lanes, avoid other vehicles, and respond to various traffic obstacles with a level of precision crucial for ensuring safety.
